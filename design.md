# Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) Simulator

The RTOS simulator is a command-line application that simulates a real-time operating system. It will manage tasks with different priorities and run them according to a scheduling algorithm.

## Components

1. Task: A basic unit of execution with a priority and a duration.
2. Scheduler: Responsible for managing tasks and running them according to their priorities.
3. Command Line Interface (CLI): A user interface to interact with the simulator, add tasks, and start the simulation.

## Scheduling Algorithm

The simulator will use a priority-based scheduling algorithm. Higher priority tasks will run before lower priority tasks. Tasks with the same priority will run in a first-come, first-served order.
